Our project, "Workly!"
For FBLA 2025 State Leadership Conference

To run:
cd into joblistings, then run "python manage.py runserver"
needs Django installation (pip install)

for the future - uploading onto Railway for link-based site access, attaching Postgres database through PgAdmin

Update: we placed Top 8 in the state!
