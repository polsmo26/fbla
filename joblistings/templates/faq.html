                                            If you’re having difficulty logging into your account, start by double-checking that you're not using a common password and make sure your password matches! Pay attention to any capitalization or extra spaces, as passwords are case-sensitive. Occasionally, high traffic may cause brief login issues, so waiting a few minutes and trying again can also resolve the problem.

                                            There are a few common reasons why an application might not submit properly. First, double-check that all required fields are completed accurately, including your resume upload, cover letter, and any additional questions the employer has provided. Ensure your resume is in an accepted format (such as PDF or DOCX) and doesn’t exceed the file size limit.
