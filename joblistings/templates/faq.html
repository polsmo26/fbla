                                            If you’re having difficulty logging into your account, start by double-checking that you're using the correct email and password combination. Pay attention to any capitalization or extra spaces, as passwords are case-sensitive. If you're still unable to access your account, try resetting your password. It can also help to clear your browser's cache and cookies or attempt to log in from a different browser or device. Occasionally, high traffic may cause brief login issues, so waiting a few minutes and trying again can also resolve the problem.

                                            There are a few common reasons why an application might not submit properly. First, double-check that all required fields are completed accurately, including your resume upload, cover letter, and any additional questions the employer has provided. Ensure your resume is in an accepted format (such as PDF or DOCX) and doesn’t exceed the file size limit. If you continue to experience issues, try refreshing the page, clearing your browser cache, or switching to a different browser.
